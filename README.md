# .valkyrie Manager (v1.1)

This is a Python 3.9/Kivy 2.0 application that helps to manage quest (.valkyrie) files (from [Valkyrie app](https://github.com/NPBruce/valkyrie))

It identifies new quests and quests with avialable update, allowing to download none, some or all of them at once.

It is possible to remove none, some or all downloaded quests too.

Its interface displays each category of quest (new, updatable or removable) and the user can mark any of displayed quests to operate (download, update or remove).

Information about requirements, instalation, execution and another stuffs may be founded at [Wiki pages](https://github.com/malkavk/ValkyrieScenariosManager/wiki)


Version Updates:

1.1 Fixed update scenario issue (after update a scenario, Valkyrie detects update as available, but manager doesn't).
